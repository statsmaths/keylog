# Educational Site to Demonstrate Local Keylogging with JavaScript

This repository hosts a GitHub pages demo of a simple JavaScript application.
You can visit the application [here](https://statsmaths.github.io/keylog/).
The code performs keylogging of input typed into a textbox. All of the
data is stored in the DOM and is downloadable as a CSV file. I use this for a
number of different pedagolical purposes:

- To demonstrate how easy it is to build a fairly invasive picture of one's
activity online using a small amount of code running in the browser. This
can be done as an activity without requiring any technical prerequisites.
- The output data is very interesting from a data science perspective. Make
use of it is a great way to demonstrate different kinds of cleaning tasks,
particularly the use of date-time manipulation, table pivots, and window
functions.
- Keylogging is a common source of data in cognitive science and experimental
linguistics. While I am not sure that the application is accurate enough for
large-scale experiments, it is a good way to introduce the general data type
and see some common patterns.
- The JavaScript code is done with plain, vanilla JS. It is a good example of
how the basics can be put together in an interesting way outside of a larger
platform.

If you make use of this demo in your work or use it in a classroom activity,
I appreciate any and all feedback or suggestions!
